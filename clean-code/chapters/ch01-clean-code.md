## Chapter 1: Clean Code

- **LeBlanc’s Law**: "Later equals never." Messes left for "later" are never cleaned up.
- **Speed Paradox**: The only way to go fast is to stay clean. Making a mess to meet a deadline is a fallacy; messy code slows you down instantly.
- **The 10:1 Ratio**: Developers spend 10x more time reading code than writing it. Always optimize for readability to maintain long-term velocity.
- **The Boy Scout Rule**: "Leave the campground cleaner than you found it." Check-in code slightly better than you found it to combat technical debt.
- **"Pretty Much What You Expected"** (Ward Cunningham): "You know you are working on clean code when each routine you read turns out to be pretty much what you expected."

**Agent relevance:**
Agents are tempted to generate "good enough" code and move on. The Boy Scout Rule and 10:1 ratio are the antidotes — always optimize for the reader, even when the reader is another agent.
