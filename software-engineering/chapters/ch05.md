## Chapter 5: Coordination and Communication Principles

### Communication and Scaling
*   **The N² Communication Problem:** Communication paths increase at a rate of n(n-1)/2. As the number of participating agents increases, the total coordination cost grows super-linearly, eventually exceeding the value of the parallel work.
*   **Brooks's Law:** Adding more agents to a late project makes it later. New agents require context-loading (reading docs/logs), which consumes the attention of existing agents and increases coordination overhead.
*   **The "Fewer and Better" Principle:** A small group of high-capability agents is consistently more productive than a large swarm of lower-tier agents. Minimal coordination overhead is the primary driver of velocity.

### Coordination Mechanisms
*   **Mutual Adjustment:** Coordination through informal, ad-hoc communication. Necessary for high-uncertainty tasks where agents must align on a novel strategy.
*   **Standardization of Outputs:** Using rigid schemas, linting rules, and strict API definitions. When outputs are standardized, agents can coordinate through the code itself, reducing the need for expensive natural-language alignment.
*   **Standardization of Work Processes:** Following established workflows (e.g., GitFlow, TDD). If every agent follows the same process, other agents can predict their actions without explicit communication.
*   **Direct Supervision (Orchestration):** A central orchestrator agent assigns atomic tasks to worker agents. Efficient for execution but creates a single point of failure and a bottleneck in reasoning.

### Organizational Patterns
*   **The Orchestrator Model:** One high-capability agent maintains the global mental model and system architecture, while specialist agents handle implementation, testing, and documentation. Preserves architectural integrity.
*   **Specialist Teams:** Deploying agents with specialized tools or knowledge for specific domains (e.g., security, database). Coordination is handled via well-defined interface boundaries.
*   **Egoless Programming (Objective Review):** Systems are most stable when authorship is decoupled from ownership. Code should be treated as community property, facilitating objective peer review and refactoring without bias.

### Operational Principles
*   **Goal Alignment:** Individual agent instructions (local goals) must be explicitly mapped to the project requirements (global goals). Without active alignment, agents may optimize locally at the expense of project delivery.
*   **Information Symmetry:** Coordination fails when agents have different views of system state. Shared state files or databases are required to ensure all agents operate on the same facts.
*   **Modular Coordination:** Agents should interact across stable module boundaries. If two agents must frequently communicate to complete a task, the code they are working on is likely too tightly coupled.
*   **Verification via Peer Review:** High-stakes tasks benefit from a multi-agent pattern: one to implement, one to critique (independent review), and one to integrate (final validation).
