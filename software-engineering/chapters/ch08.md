## Chapter 8: Task Planning, Decomposition, and Risk

### The Project Taxonomy
*   **Classification First:** Every task or project should be classified into a specific problem type to determine the appropriate planning and execution strategy.
*   **Realization Problems:** Both the goal and the method are well-defined. These tasks require efficient execution and strict adherence to known patterns (e.g., "Implement this specific CRUD interface").
*   **Design Problems:** The goal is clear, but the method is not yet determined. These require an architectural phase to select the best path before execution begins (e.g., "Build a system that can handle 10k concurrent users").
*   **Exploration Problems:** Neither the goal nor the method is fully known. These require an iterative "spike" approach to discover constraints (e.g., "Investigate why this legacy system intermittently fails under load").
*   **Taxonomy Utility:** Properly identifying a task as "Exploration" prevents the agent from falling into a "Realization" trap where it attempts to write code before understanding the problem space.

### Task Decomposition (Work Breakdown Structure)
*   **WBS Definition:** A hierarchical decomposition of the total scope of work to be carried out to accomplish project objectives.
*   **Atomic Decomposition:** Decompose complex objectives into unit tasks that are small enough to be accurately estimated and verified.
*   **Output-Oriented:** Tasks should be defined by the artifact they produce (e.g., "API documentation," "Unit test suite") rather than the activity performed (e.g., "Thinking," "Researching").
*   **The 100% Rule:** The WBS must include 100% of the work defined by the project scope and capture all deliverables—internal, external, and interim.
*   **Verifiable Milestones:** Each branch of the decomposition must terminate in a milestone with an unambiguous "done" state.
*   **Independence:** Aim for sub-tasks that are loosely coupled, allowing for parallel execution by multiple agents or processes.

### Dependencies and the Critical Path
*   **Logical Dependencies:** Tasks often have a strict order (e.g., you cannot test a module that has not been implemented).
*   **The Critical Path:** The longest sequence of dependent tasks that determines the minimum possible time to complete the project.
*   **Bottleneck Identification:** Any delay in a task on the critical path will directly delay the entire project.
*   **Float/Slack:** Tasks not on the critical path have "float," meaning they can be delayed without impacting the final deadline.
*   **Parallelization Limits:** Understanding the critical path reveals the limits of parallel processing; adding more agents to a serial dependency chain will not speed up the result.

### Risk Management
*   **The Risk Cycle:** Risk management is a continuous loop of Identification → Assessment → Mitigation → Monitoring.
*   **Proactive Identification:** Before starting, list potential failure points: breaking changes in dependencies, ambiguous requirements, API rate limits.
*   **Risk Assessment:** Evaluate identified risks based on Probability (how likely?) and Impact (how bad?).
*   **Mitigation Planning:** Develop "Plan B" scenarios for high-impact risks. Mitigation may involve early action to reduce probability (e.g., locking dependency versions).
*   **Risk Monitoring:** Define triggers or indicators that a risk is becoming a reality, necessitating an immediate pivot.
*   **Common High-Impact Risks:** Scope creep, hidden technical debt, integration mismatches between sub-tasks, and loss of environment state.

### Progress Tracking and Binary Reporting
*   **Binary Reporting:** A task is either 100% done or 0% done. 
*   **The "90% Done" Trap:** Avoid reporting percentage-based progress. Percentages are subjective and frequently obscure the fact that the most difficult edge cases remain unaddressed.
*   **Verifiable Completion:** Progress is measured solely by the delivery of the artifacts defined in the WBS.
*   **Baseline Comparison:** Regularly compare the current state of the WBS against the initial plan to detect drift early.
*   **Continuous Re-planning:** As Exploration or Design tasks provide new information, the WBS must be updated to reflect newfound Realization requirements.
