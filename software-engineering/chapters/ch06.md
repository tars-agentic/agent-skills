## Chapter 6: Software Quality

### Perspectives and Definitions
*   **Garvin's Quality Perspectives:** Quality is not a single trait but is viewed through five lenses:
    *   **Transcendent:** Quality as an ideal or excellence ("I know it when I see it").
    *   **User-based:** Fitness for purpose; how well the software meets specific user needs.
    *   **Product-based:** Internal attributes and characteristics of the software itself.
    *   **Value-based:** The balance between performance/features and cost/efficiency.
    *   **Manufacturing-based:** Conformance to requirements and specifications; "doing it right the first time."
*   **Quality Factors (McCall's Vocabulary):** A foundational list of 11 factors:
    *   **Product Operation:** Correctness (satisfies specs), Reliability (performs intended function), Efficiency (resource usage), Integrity (security/access control), Usability (ease of use).
    *   **Product Revision:** Maintainability (effort to find/fix errors), Flexibility (effort to change), Testability (effort to verify).
    *   **Product Transition:** Portability (effort to move environments), Reusability (use in other apps), Interoperability (effort to couple with other systems).
*   **ISO 9126 Quality Model:** Decomposes quality into six main characteristics (Functionality, Reliability, Usability, Efficiency, Maintainability, Portability), each broken into sub-characteristics (e.g., Maintainability includes Analyzability, Changeability, Stability, and Testability).

### Quality Management and Process
*   **QA vs. QC:** Quality Assurance is process-oriented (preventing defects through disciplined workflows), while Quality Control is product-oriented (detecting defects through testing and reviews).
*   **The Closed-Loop Principle:** Data from QC (defects found) must feed back to improve QA processes (preventing future occurrences).
*   **TQM Concepts:** Continuous improvement, customer satisfaction, and the premise that quality is everyone's responsibility.
*   **CMMI Levels:** (1) Initial/Ad Hoc, (2) Managed (project level), (3) Defined (org level), (4) Quantitatively Managed, (5) Optimizing (continuous improvement).

### Reviews and Inspections
*   **Walkthroughs:** Informal, developer-led sessions where the author explains logic to find bugs and improve clarity.
*   **Inspections:** Formal, structured reviews with defined roles (Moderator, Reader, Recorder, Reviewer) and checklists of common fault types.
*   **The Power of Early Detection:** Finding and fixing a defect during design or code inspection is an order of magnitude cheaper than finding it during system testing or after release.

### Metrics and Measurement
*   **Complexity Metrics (McCabe's):** Cyclomatic complexity V(G) measures the number of linearly independent paths through source code. High values indicate code that is difficult to test, maintain, and understand.
*   **Essential vs. Accidental Complexity:** Distinguish between complexity inherent to the problem (essential) and complexity introduced by poor implementation (accidental).
*   **Metrics are Indicators, Not Absolutes:** A high complexity score is a warning light for further investigation, not definitive proof of bad code.

### Agentic Quality Principles
*   **Quality Trade-offs:** Improving one quality factor often degrades another (e.g., extreme Efficiency can reduce Maintainability). Balance based on project context.
*   **Maintainability for Collaboration:** When agents write code, Maintainability is the primary factor. Code must be readable and analyzable by both humans and subsequent agent passes.
*   **Testability as a Constraint:** Prioritize writing testable code (small modules, clear interfaces) to ensure the feedback loop of Quality Control remains fast and accurate.
*   **Portability and Reusability:** Avoid environment-specific hardcoding and tight coupling unless explicitly required.
*   **The 5-Step Improvement Cycle:** (1) Characterize current state, (2) Set quality goals, (3) Plan the improvement, (4) Execute (refactor), (5) Evaluate the result using metrics.
*   **Built-in, Not Tested-in:** Quality is achieved by following a disciplined generation process (QA) rather than attempting to fix all issues in a post-generation testing phase (QC).
