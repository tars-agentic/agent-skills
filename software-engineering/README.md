# Software Engineering Principles

Distilled from Hans van Vliet's *Software Engineering: Principles and Practice* (3rd ed., 2007).

This is a **reference skill for AI coding agents** — 15 chapters of timeless software engineering wisdom extracted through the lens of: *what principles still hold when agents, not humans, are writing the code?*

## What Was Cut

The original 696-page textbook was distilled in two passes:

1. **First pass**: Each chapter condensed to dense bulleted reference (~1,787 lines)
2. **Second pass**: Critical review through an agentic lens, then refined:
   - Ch05 (People Management) → 23 lines of coordination principles (was 148)
   - Ch07 (Cost Estimation) → 14 lines of complexity scaling (was 105)
   - Ch10 (UML Modeling) → 29 lines of modeling concepts (was 101)
   - Human org charts, management theory, dated tool surveys, and formula-heavy content removed
   - Case study lessons, design patterns, code smells, testing strategies, and architectural trade-offs preserved
